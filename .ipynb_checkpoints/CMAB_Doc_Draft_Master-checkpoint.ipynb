    "Sales Data often lacks information about rejected deals, as it typically focuses only on successfully completed transactions. This introduces a bias known as survival bias, where the dataset excludes valuable insights from lost deals. To develop a more accurate model of price sensitivity, it is crucial to incorporate information about whether a specific offer was accepted or rejected by the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I aim to create a framework for dynamic individualized price optimization using multi-arm contextual bandits. These bandit algorithms enable the measurement of price sensitivity, but they are not readily available in standardized forms. While existing implementations often cater to use cases like recommender systems and click-through rates, the pricing use case differs in some fundamental ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the action set (i.e., the prices) can be modeled as either continuous or discrete and possesses an order. For instance, a successful sale at price x implies successful sales at prices <= x. Secondly, the reward function is not binary. The customer's reaction to a given price simple yes/no response is binary. However, the optimization objective extends beyond maximizing the number of successful deals and includes maximizing the monetary rewards associated with these deals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this summary, I consolidate much of my research on this topic and propose adaptations to bandit algorithms that are better suited for the pricing use case. Additionally, I suggest approaches to address challenges related to low data throughput, such as the concept of cross-learning. These insights aim to enhance the effectiveness of dynamic price optimization and provide valuable strategies for dealing with limited data availability.\n",

    "Another logical idea is to choose the action not by a simple argmax, but with a probability proportional to the estimates, such as $a∼Mult(softmax(\\mathbb{E}[r_1 \\vert f, x_t], ..., \\mathbb{E}[r_K \\vert f, x_t]))$ where $softmax(x_1, ..., x_n) = exp(x_1, ..., x_n)/\\sum_i exp(x_i)$. Since our rewards are small percentages bounded by zero and one, it may be sensible to apply an inverse sigmoid function $sigmoid^{-1}(x) = log(\\frac{x}{1-x})$ on these values before applying the softmax function. In order to make such a policy deal with the old data losing representativity quickly, a typical trick is to inflate the estimates before applying the softmax function by a multiplier $m$ (later referred to as **recency weight**) that gets larger with the number of rounds, so that the policy would tend to argmax with later iterations ([Adapting multi-armed bandits policies to contextual bandits scenarios](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04383.pdf), Section 6)."

    "**Results:** all algorithms seem to learn very fast and converge after about 90 batches with 10 observations each \\-- granted, they are learning a very simple distribution here. Thompson Sampling, which is proven to be an efficient algorithm, does outperform the Epsilon Greedy algorithm a little and seems to converge towards more rewarding actions. The Softmax algorithms performance is quite poor. When the binary rewards and the regrets (the reward difference between the most rewarding action and the action chosen by the algorithm) one sees that the Softmax algorithm does win a comparable number of deals but does so expensively. The Upper Confidence Bound algorithm (here applying the 60% quantile) does learn but consistently chooses margins which are too low and looses many deals. This indicates that the bootstrapped quanitle does not converge towards the true mean very quickly. Perhaps a larger number of bootstrap samples could improve theses results."
